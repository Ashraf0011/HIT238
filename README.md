# Hello there! This a my HIT238 unit's website description.

## You will find some information about my mobile web application and may be some insights about it.

Let's talk about myself.
I'm Ashraful from Bangladesh. I'm studying  IT in Charles Darwin University, Darwin NT.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Ashraf0011/HIT238/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
You will see some of my practise apps are on github.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Ashraf0011/HIT238/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
